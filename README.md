# OuiseCoin

Mock cryptocurrency based on the Bitcoin protocol. The network consists of nodes that are connected via web sockets. Each node has a public and private key and gets awarded the coin for mining each block, just like Bitcoin. Each node has a ledger of transactions that can be used to verify each transaction's validity. I implemented this protocol in TypeScript with node.js.

## Technologies Used
